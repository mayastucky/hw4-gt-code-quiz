# hw4-gt-code-quiz

## Description

This program is designed to give budding programmer's a chance to test their skills in JavaScript.

## Installation

Clone the repo and run index.html in your browser.

## Usage

This is a quiz for programmers/those who love to dabble in code. Start the quiz to begin your timer for 75 seconds, and make your way through the quiz, noting that any wrong answer you make will subtract 10 seconds from your remaining time. If you run out of time before the quiz is over, the quiz will end. Good luck!

## Credits

This was a solo project completed as homework for the Georgia Tech Full-Stack Flex Program. As always, many thanks to my peers who are always willing to work out the kinks together.
